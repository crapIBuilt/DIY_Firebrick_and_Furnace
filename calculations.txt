I want furnace to be able to hold 2kg of metal on average. The least dense metal frequently
used is aluminum which has a density of 2.7 cm3/g. This matters because the
least dense metal would take the largest volume.=
This means that 2000g of aluminum would
would take 1/2.7 of the space an equivalent amount of water would take. 2000 / 2.7 = 740.74 ml or cm3 (same unit)
This means the furnace active volume must be able to hold 740.74 ml of water to be a 2kg furnace.
If the furnace chamber was a perfect cube then each side would be the cube = root of 740.74
would be 9 cm. I want the chamber to be taller rather than cubic
but calculation the sides of a cube helped me decide what base dimensions I wanted
for the furnace. I want it to be a little bigger than that so that I can safely
place a 2kg graphite crucible inside without it being too close to the
heating coil. The 2kg crucible is 58mm dia 110mm tall. I will
make the chamber 100x100x150. There is no specific reason for this
except that it matches my needs and has a little extra room in case I need
it.
The perlite is bound using silicon dioxide deposited via water glass.
This should have a glass transition temp of about 1200c. So it will just barely work.
The brick will get soft and sticky if heated to 1200 or above but the heater
is recommended for max 1150c so it should be fine. After googling
a bunch it seems that 5cm is roughly enough. I will make the walls 5cm
thick to increase strength and reduce heat leakage.
lid = 200 x 200 x 50 = 2000 cm3 (2L)
active volume = 100 x 100 x 150 = 1500 cm3 (1.5L)
furnace main body without active volume = 200 x 200 x 200 = 8000 cm3 (8L)
furnace total volume = 8L - 1.5L = 6.5L
total brick mix volume = 6.5L (body) + 2L (lid) = 8.5L
I used one batch of water glass per 2L of perlite. I had to add about 200ml of water to evenly distribute the water glass and to make the mixture workable.
All the water should evaporate during baking/drying.
